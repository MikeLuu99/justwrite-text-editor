# Focused Text Editor

## Description

Focused Text Editor is a unique writing tool designed to boost productivity by eliminating distractions. It forces users to focus on their writing by "locking" them into the editor for a set amount of time. If users attempt to switch tabs or leave the application, they risk losing their work.

## Features

- Distraction-free writing environment
- Customizable lock-in duration
- Optional dark mode
- Lose all writings if you switch tabs

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/MikeLuu99/focused-text-editor.git
cd focused-in-editor
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Set your desired lock-in duration
3. Start writing
4. The editor will prevent you from switching tabs until the time is up
5. Your work is automatically saved upon time completion

## Warning

This application is designed to push the boundaries of focused writing. Please use it responsibly and be aware that attempting to exit before the set time may result in loss of work.

The text editor is implemented from this repo https://github.com/Aslam97/shadcn-minimal-tiptap
